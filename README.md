 AI Credit Risk Scoring Model project:

Developed an AI-powered credit risk scoring system to predict the probability of loan default using historical borrower data.

The objective was to help financial institutions make faster, data-driven lending decisions and reduce exposure to high-risk applicants.

Utilized data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key risk indicators such as income level, credit history, loan amount, and debt ratios.

Built a machine learning classification model to categorize applicants into low, medium, and high risk.

Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.

Implemented a train-test split strategy to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

The solution can be integrated into fintech lending platforms for automated credit approval and risk monitoring.

Demonstrates practical application of data science in banking, proptech financing, and AI-based mortgage pre-approval systems.
